üîç How It Works
GitInsight provides an intuitive way to analyze your GitHub repositories through these key flows:
1. Authentication Flow

Users sign in with GitHub OAuth
Our backend exchanges the code for an access token
JWT token is generated for secure API access
User is redirected to the dashboard

2. Repository Selection

We fetch all accessible repositories from GitHub
Users can filter, search, and select repositories to analyze
Selected repositories are saved to the user's preferences

3. Analytics Dashboard

Repository data is fetched from GitHub API
Pull request metrics are calculated and displayed
Contributor statistics are visualized
Branch activity is tracked and presented in charts

4. Interactive Filtering

Filter analytics by contributor
Adjust time ranges for different perspectives
Toggle between various chart types
Compare metrics across different time periods
